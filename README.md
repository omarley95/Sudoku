# Sudoku-Solver
I created a Python script to solve a 9 x 9 sudoku. This is the first iteration of a project to be expanded on. 

An additional feature to be implemented is for the program to take an image as an input. This will be an image of a 9 x 9 sudoku and using computer vision techniques, we can translate that image to an array.

### Requirements
- numpy

### Instructions
1. User must input the sudoku to be solved as a numpy array.
2. User must run the function solve with the numpy array as the parameter
